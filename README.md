# Introducing the Omni Protocol

You can access the Omni Protocol through the official Web App.

## What is Omni?

Omni is a decentralized protocol with a foundation of providing lending and borrowing services for various assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can lend their NFTs and ERC-20 tokens to earn income in the form of interest. Additionally, users can use their lended assets as collateral for borrowing assets.

The Omni protocol aims to provide users access to cash and profits without selling their assets. Omni uses a pool-based money market model whereby users supply their assets to a pool to earn interest and instantly borrow from the pool when collateralizing their asset.

The Omni founders believe in a future where tokenized assets proliferate with different kinds of utility, applications, and connection to real-life assets. With the recent prominence of the NFT collectibles (from early 2021), the founders aim to launch products and features that add value to this segment of the NFT ecosystem by enhancing price discovery and liquidity.

Users can supply their NFTs and ERC-20 tokens in the protocol to:

* Earn interest yield - ERC-20 tokens supplied earn interest that is part of the share of interest paid by borrowers of those assets
* Borrow from the lending pool - Once an asset is supplied, users can borrow from the lending pool of ERC-20 tokens. Users can hold their borrow positions so long as the value of collateral is high enough to keep it within the liquidation threshold. Borrowers can repay their loan over time.

NFT holders can maintain the utility and security of their assets when using the Omni protocol while getting access to cash without selling. Specifically the protocol has and offers the following:

* **Insurance Reserve for the protocol** - This is a pool that backs up and covers lenders in the event that the protocol is compromised
* **Tokenized NFT and escrow** - NFTs supplied into escrow contracts that only allow for transfers in stipulated conditions. Upon supplying, users also receive back a nToken, a mirror of the NFT and its metadata, that is used when redeeming the token.
* **Flash claim and airdrop coverage** - Holders can claim any airdrops while their assets are supplied in the protocol through the flash claim feature.
* **Third-Party audited smart contracts** - We have completed a smart contract audit with Veridise and are undergoing additional audits with other top auditors. See the [External Audits](ethereum-network/risk-framework/external-audits.md) section for more information.
