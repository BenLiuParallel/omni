# Uniswap V3 LP Token As Collateral

### Background

Uniswap V3 is one of the largest DeFi protocol in the Ethereum L1 ecosystem hosting 3.35B TVL and more than 1B dollar worth of daily trading volume on average. It is the go-to platform for liquidity providers and DeFi traders.

As Uniswap does not provide any staking function for liquidity providers, and there is not any sizable protocol that accepts Uniswap V3 LP tokens for staking/depositing or any other functions, there is no means for liquidity providers to generate yield beyond the trading fee earning.

We see there is a unique opportunity to tap into such huge mainstream market by allowing Uniswap V3 LP token to be used as collateral to borrow stablecoins on OMNI. This will no doubt drastically drive up the TVL of the platform and improve the utilization of stablecoins, which is in general low in such a bear market.
