### Research

**Backtesting**

In order to determine the correct periods to use in our pricing algorithm we researched the impact that different timeframes would have on historical data.&#x20;

We need to strike a balance between responsive and stable to best serve the needs of our money market.



Below are examples of different periods on two different NFT projects.&#x20;
