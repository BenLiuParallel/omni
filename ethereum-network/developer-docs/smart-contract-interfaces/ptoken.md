# PToken

pTokens are tokens minted and burnt upon _supply_ and _withdraw_ of ERC20 assets to a Parallel market, which denote the amount of crypto assets supplied and the yield earned on those assets. The pTokensâ€™ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the pTokens' reserves are distributed to pToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance.
