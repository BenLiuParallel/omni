# NToken

nTokens are tokens minted and burnt upon _supply_ and _withdraw_ of ERC721 assets to a Parallel market, which denote the amount of crypto assets supplied and the yield earned on those assets. The nTokensâ€™ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the nTokens' reserves are distributed to nToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance.
