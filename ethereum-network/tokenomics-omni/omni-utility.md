# OMNI Utility

## What can I do from holding OMNI

OMNI and sOMNI (staked Omni) can be used in the governance process as described in the [Governance section](governance.md). In addition, OMNI can be staked to sOMNI and sOMNI holder will receive staking yield that can be claimed for additional staked OMNI. In the future, OMNI will be used to get more access to premium product features such as increased collateralization and extra liquidation protection.

## How are incentives distributed?

Incentives will be distributed as sOMNI (staked OMNI) on a per block basis once assets are staked. In order to receive the sOMNI, you must first claim it by clicking on the claim sOMNI button on the dApp home screen.

## How do I redeem OMNI?

You can redeem OMNI from sOMNI after the 21-day cooldown period. If you claim additional sOMNI within the 21-day cooldown period, the cooldown period will get pushed back based on the amount of additional sOMNI you claim.
