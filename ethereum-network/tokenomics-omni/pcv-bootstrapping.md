# PCV Bootstrapping

## Introduction

The PCV Liquidity Bootstrapping is an open offering of OMNI to attract and bootstrap liquidity into the Omni protocol lending pool. Anyone can participate by providing ETH and the ERC-20 tokens that make up the Omni lending pool to receive sOMNI tokens. 10% of the overall OMNI supply i.e. 1,000,000 OMNI will be distributed via this initiative.

The PCV Liquidity Bootstrapping rounds will begin once the Beta launch period is complete.

## How can I participate?

You can participate by clicking on the Liquidity Offers section on the dApp homepage to enter the Liquidity Bootstrap page. In this page, you can see the amount of OMNI available in the round. If there are still available OMNI in the round, you can get sOMNI by entering the amount of ETH or ERC-20 token you want to provide in the 'Get sOMNI' widget. Click confirm, approve the transaction, and the transaction will be submitted. Once successful, you will receive the sOMNI in you wallet.

## How is the amount of sOMNI I receive determined?

Retrieving sOMNI via the PCV Liquidity Bootstrapping will be at a discounted rate towards what is available on the market i.e. decentralized exchanges. The price of sOMNI and OMNI will be determined at launch.

## How are the funds I provide used?

At launch, 100% of the funds provided via PCV will be transferred to the lending pool from which borrowers can draw from. The interest on these loans will be passed on to the Community Treasury.
