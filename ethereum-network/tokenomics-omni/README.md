# Tokenomics, OMNI

## Introducing the OMNI token

The OMNI token will be used to support governance mechanisms, financial incentives, and utilities on the Parallel Omni protocol. OMNI is an ERC-20 token. After the Beta launch period, OMNI will be used to bootstrap liquidity via the PCV mechanism. OMNI will be distributed as sOMNI (staked OMNI). sOMNI will accrue staking rewards in the form of additional sOMNI. OMNI and sOMNI holders will be able to participate in governance which includes proposing new improvements and voting on proposals. In the future, OMNI will be used to get access to premium features launched on the protocol.

## Token Supply and Distribution

The total supply of OMNI will be 1,000,000,000. Once total supply is distributed, there will be no more new OMNI tokens introduced to supply.

The final token distribution allocation will be as follows:

* Developer Studio - 30%, vested over 4 years
* PCV Liquidity Bootstrapping - 10%
* Community and Users - 60%, broken down into the following with amounts initially decided by Developer Studio and then approved via Governance
  * Incentives
  * Liquidity Providers on decentralized exchanges
  * Community Owned Treasury
