# Governance

## Introduction

The OMNI token and its distribution aims to drive the decentralization of the Omni protocol. Over time OMNI holders will propose and vote on key proposals to maintain and bring the protocol forward.

## What do I need to vote?

In order to vote you need to have OMNI or sOMNI (staked OMNI) tokens. You can use all of your OMNI and sOMNI to vote. Changes are implemented based on the total number of OMNI / sOMNI tokens that vote yes or no.

## How do I vote?

Governance is handled via a forum on Snapshot Space. Community members i.e. OMNI holders can create proposals, evaluate, and refine them on the forum. The community developer studio will then put a proposal up for vote. All OMNI and sOMNI holders can then vote on the proposal

## When will a proposal be implemented?

A proposal is implemented provided there are enough overall votes and enough overall 'Yes' votes. The **quorum** % represents the number of overall votes necessary for it to be considered while the **support** % represents the percentage of yes votes necessary to pass a proposal.

For example:

1. If a proposal has 20% quorum and 60% support and receives 12% yes and 7% no, then it will not pass because it only has a 19% quorum (12% + 7%).
2. If a proposal has 20% quorum and 60% support and receives 15% yes and 6% no, then it will pass as it has a 21% quorum (15% + 6% = 21%) and a 71% support, 15% / ( 15% + 6%) = 71%.
