# Supplying NFTs

1\) To start earning interest on your NFTs, the first step is to stake them. On the NFT MM webpage, please select "Supply NFT" to begin the process. Alternatively, scroll down to explore and either supply an NFT or ERC-20 token from our list.

2\) Please select "Supply" under one of the four NFT collections displayed. Currently, only these four collections are available for staking. Don't worry if you don't see an NFT collection you hold â€“ more NFT collections will be added!

3\) You will be prompted to connect a wallet if you have not yet done so. Press "Connect Wallet to Begin."&#x20;

(Note: The wallet can be connected prior to Step 1 as well, by clicking the "Connect wallet" button on the top right corner of the page)

4\) Select your wallet of choice. You will want to choose whichever wallet extension you use to store your NFTs.

5\) Once your wallet has been connected and you have selected "Supply," you will see NFTs from that collection on display, if you hold them within your connected wallet.

This will prompt a signature from your wallet browser. Please confirm to finish supplying your NFT.
