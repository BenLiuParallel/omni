# Borrow



In order to borrow assets on Parallel Omni, you must first supply assets as collateral. To learn how to supply an NFT or an ERC-20 Token, please refer to the guides below:

Supply NFT Guide - link

Supply ERC-20 Guide - link

1\) Once you have supplied assets, please select "Borrow" on the Main Omni page.&#x20;

2\) Once "Borrow" is selected, a box will appear where the user can decide how much they would like to borrow.

Omni is designed to create an easy-to-use interface for users of all experience levels. Thus, the system will let the user know how much they can borrow, based on their supplied collateral.

Enter the amount of assets you would like to borrow in the box.

3\) Upon entering a value into the "Amount" field, the numbers for Borrow APY, Reward APY, and New Borrow Limit will update based on the borrow amount you designated.

Borrow APY - represents the variable interest cost, or how what the interest rate is that the user will have to pay back.

Reward APY - represents the amount of reward tokens a user can earn for borrowing.

New Borrow Limit - represents the max amount that a user can borrow. This number reflects the max amount you can borrow, based on all your Lend and Borrow positions on Omni (rather than just for that asset).

The bar pictured above reflects the total amount of assets you have borrowed within Omni.&#x20;

The yellow marker represents the Borrow Limit.

The red marker represents the Liquidation price.

4\) Once you have decided on the amount to borrow, please select "Approve to Continue." This will prompt your wallet extension, and you will need to approve the transaction on your wallet.

5\) After the approval, please wait a few moments for the approval to go through. Once the "Loading" text disappears, the "Borrow \<token name>" button will turn blue. Please click on the button to prompt one more wallet extension pop up.

6\) Confirm the transaction one final time on your wallet's browser extension and wait for the "Success" notification to appear on the top right corner of the page.
