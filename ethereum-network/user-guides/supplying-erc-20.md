# Supplying ERC-20

1\) On the top right corner of the Omni page, please select "Connect Wallet," to select your wallet of choice. You will want to choose whichever wallet extension you use to store your NFTs.

2\) Scroll down to the "ERC20 Tokens" section of the page to supply an ERC-20 token. Select "Supply" for your ERC-20 token of choice.

This will prompt a box to pop up.

5\) Once you submit, the box will close and a "Confirming Transaction" notice will appear on the top right corner.

6\) When "Confirming Transaction" disappears and is replaced by "Success," that will signify that you have successfully supplied your ERC-20 token.
